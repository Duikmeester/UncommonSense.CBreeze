# 2013 vs. 2013 R2
## Key groups
Key groups were removed from the table designer UI. Imported key groups are imported and stored, nonetheless, and included in subsequent exports. Decision: no action required.
## Xmlport schema Unbound
Introduced for nodes of type Element Text or Element Field. Simple nullable boolean. Decision: introduce.
Note: Appears in the development UI also at XmlPort level, but does not get exported.
## Xmlport encoding
Encoding for text format now has options MS-DOS,UTF-8,UTF-16,WINDOWS. Encoding options for XML format remain UTF-8,UTF-16,ISO-8859-2. Decision: introduce.
## Action images
New action images (some or all starting with the word "Tile") were introduced. Decision: add to RunTime class.
