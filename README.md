# UncommonSense.CBreeze

## Introduction
- How would you go about changing all present instances of a certain table property in an object text file? Maybe using regular expressions.
- Now, how would you go about changing a certain property in all tables in an object text file, but currently the property doesn't have a value? More difficult, but still probably regular expressions.
- What if that property needs to be set to the value of another property, e.g. the ENU CaptionML must be set equal to the Name?
- How would you do similar operations in an XML file? Probably using the XMLDOM. That's why we need a DOM for the NAV object text format.

## Why use C/Breeze?
- Script your development work as much as possible
- Avoid the friction caused by an outdated development environment
- Focus on the semantics; leave the syntax to C/Breeze
- Don't just apply design patterns - automate them!

## Design Goals
- Intuitive object model for anybody familiar with C/SIDE;
- ...

## Design Decisions
### Supporting multiple NAV versions from the same codebase
- Conditional compilation symbols for each NAV version;
- If `NAV2016` is set, also set `NAV2015`; if `NAV2015` is set, also set `NAV2013R2` etc.;
- NAV 2013 is our starting point; no conditional compilation symbol is required for NAV 2013;
- Features introduced in e.g. NAV 2015 can test for `#if NAV2015`;
- Features declared obsolete in e.g. NAV 2015 can test for `#if !NAV2015`
- Features introduced in e.g. NAV 2013R2 and declared obsolete in NAV 2015 should test for `#if NAV2013R2 && !NAV2015`: in NAV 2013, `NAV2013R2` is still false, in NAV 2013R2, `NAV2013R2` is true *and* `NAV2015` is not true yet (meaning `!NAV2015` evaluates to true), and in NAV 2015, `NAV2015` is true (meaning `!NAV2015` evaluates to false).
Sample codebase, build script and test script here: https://gist.github.com/jhoek/18bca9bddc5d05c904c6.

Between NAV 2013 and NAV 2013 R2, the KeyGroups property was removed from table keys. In other words, the NAV 2013 R2 developer UI no longer offers an option to set the KeyGroups for a table key. Importing a text file, created in an older version of NAV, that still contains key groups will not change this, but behind the scenes, the key groups are imported and stored as before. Exporting the containing table from NAV 2013 R2 results in a text file that is byte-by-byte identical with the original file.

In other words: the ability to declare properties obsolete may not be as important as it first seems. The C/Breeze Core library should still expose the obsolete property, the parser should still report it, the application builder should still set it, and the writer should still write it. It seems that conditional compilation will be primarily important for *introducing*, not for removing features.

### Keep UncommonSense.CBreeze.Core lean and mean
Any cleverness like auto-captioning, auto-objectproperties or even auto-assigning (U)IDs (see also below) would unnecessarily complexify UncommonSense.CBreeze.Core, and could always be implemented later as extension methods.
### Auto-assigned (U)IDs
(U)IDs are mandatory for items, and should be tested when adding an item to a collection. Auto-assigning (U)IDs complexifies the container code too much. We could aways introduce a (set of) extension method(s) later that will add container items with auto-assigned (U)IDs.
### Type property for derived types
If type AB and AC derive from type A, type A should have an abstract read-only property of an enum type that has B and C as its values. AB and AC should implement the abstract property and return the correct enum value.

## Roadmap
- PowerShell pattern for Journal entity types
- positional arguments for Automation namespace
- Pester tests for PowerShell functions
- Repair FIXME's
- Support for NAV 2013R2, 2015 and 2016:
  - AccessByPermission, EvalForAccessByPermission
  - DefaultLayOut, WordMergeDataItem [report]
  - Temporary [dataitem]
  - UpdatePropagation
  - Scope
  - Image
  - ShowMandatory
  - Upgrade [codeunit type]
  - Upgrade|TableSynchSetup|CheckProcondition [upgrade codeunit function type]

## Ideas for future patterns, improvements
- See https://gist.github.com/jhoek/059f1bafe28d1ee24cb8. 
- A pattern for adding dimension support
- Make parser faster by doing more stuff in parallel; using F#?

## Known issues
### Objects with a time and no date
Objects with a time and no date will have 01-01-01 as their date after an import/export cycle. In order to add the object time to the non-existent object date (which are stored together in a single property of type DateTime), the date is initialised to DateTime.MinValue.Date. Separating the Date and Time object properties would probably resolve this.
